 *
 * Two things about `fitToBox` that are easy to get wrong, and were:
 *
 * 1. Padding is world units, not pixels (see `padding` above).
 * 2. It **snaps the polar angle to the nearest 90°** internally —
 *    `rotateTo(theta, roundToStep(phi, PI_HALF))`. Setting `min/maxPolarAngle`
 *    to the desired angle *before* fitting makes the two fight: the fit is
 *    computed for a snapped orientation and then clamped back. So the polar
 *    limits are released for the fit and re-applied after, which also means the
 *    fitted distance is measured against a level shot rather than a tilted one.
