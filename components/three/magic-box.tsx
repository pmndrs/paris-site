 * - `room` orients the AO box. These are the original example's values. The box
 *   is closed and lit from inside, so this only decides which baked corner you
 *   are looking into — any of them "works", they just look different.
 * - `facing` turns the glyph to look out through this slot, mapping its default
 *   +z to the slot's own normal. The original never needed this because a torus
 *   reads the same from every angle. A numeral does not, and using the room
 *   values here points half the glyphs at a side wall.
