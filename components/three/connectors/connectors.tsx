/**
 * A container with no walls.
 *
 * After Lusion's connectors (via `pmndrs/examples/lusion-connectors`), rebuilt
 * on R3F v10 and WebGPU. Gravity is off; every frame each body takes an impulse
 * toward where it belongs proportional to how far out it has drifted, which is a
 * spring. What holds the pile together is that spring fighting the bodies' own
 * collisions — so it packs, sloshes, and re-settles, and none of that needs a
 * box to be in. On the demo page "where it belongs" is the origin for every
 * body, as in the original; behind the footer it is a slot each across the
 * width, which is what turns the pile into a band. See `spreadX` in `config.ts`.
 *
 * The cursor is a kinematic ball with no mesh. It has no forces of its own; it
 * simply cannot be overlapped, so shoving it through the pile displaces
 * everything in its way.
 *
 * What changed on the way over from the original:
 *  - the connector `.glb` is gone — the bodies are generated (see `shapes.ts`);
 *  - `MeshTransmissionMaterial` is gone with it. That one is a WebGL shader
 *    material; on WebGPU three does real transmission natively, so the glass
 *    body is a plain `meshPhysicalNodeMaterial` with `transmission: 1`;
 *  - no `EffectComposer`/N8AO. `@react-three/postprocessing` is WebGL-only, and
 *    the ambient occlusion it added is doing much less work here than it does
 *    against the original's flat background.
