/**
 * The grain gradient behind the closing CTA, and the demo at
 * /demos/grain-gradient. Modelled on Paper Shaders' grain gradient — written in
 * TSL rather than ported, but following its structure, which gets two things
 * right that are easy to get wrong.
 *
 * **The grain does not animate.** It is a static field locked to pixels, so it
 * reads as a sheet of paper the shape moves underneath. Resampling it per frame
 * instead — the obvious way to build "film grain" — makes the whole thing look
 * like an x-ray or a noisy video feed. Nothing else about the effect survives
 * that mistake.
 *
 * **The grain is added to the shape, not painted over it.** Noise perturbs the
 * scalar field *before* the colour ramp reads it, so grain in a dark region
 * pushes that pixel up into the next band and takes on its colour. The practical
 * effect is that grain brightens as it nears a blob, as though the blob were
 * lighting it. An overlay cannot do that — it just sits there being dust.
 *
 * Two separate noise quantities do that work, as in the original:
 *  - `distort` displaces the field in both directions, roughening the bands.
 *  - `lift` is clamped positive, so it only ever brightens.
 *
 * Grayscale by default, and transparent: it lifts the black behind the type
 * rather than painting over it.
 *
 * Every dial is a TSL uniform rather than a constant folded into the graph, so
 * the demo's controls take effect without recompiling the shader on each drag.
