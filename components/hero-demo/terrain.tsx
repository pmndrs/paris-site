 * Ground, river and park for the block city.
 *
 * The ground plane exists because without it the sky (and with
 * `mirrorBelowHorizon`, the *flipped* sky) is visible straight through the
 * city floor — the buildings sit on nothing. A dark disc big enough to reach
 * the horizon fixes both that and the free-floating look of the shadows.
 *
 * The river is a ribbon mesh swept along `geography.ts`'s spline — the same
 * curve the building scatter rejects against, so the banks always match.
 * Water is a node material: near-mirror roughness so it reflects the sky/IBL,
 * with a cheap animated noise shimmer in color and roughness so it reads as
 * moving water instead of smoked glass. No vertex displacement — at hero
 * distance the shimmer is what sells it, not silhouettes.
