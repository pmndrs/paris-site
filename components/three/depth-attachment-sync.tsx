/**
 * Works around a three.js multi-canvas bug (SPEC.md §2). Drop one inside every
 * `<Canvas>` that shares the renderer — including the primary.
 *
 * `WebGPUBackend._getDefaultRenderPassDescriptor` builds the depth-stencil
 * attachment view once per canvas and caches it on the renderer's per-canvas
 * data, rebuilding only when the sample count changes. The colour attachment,
 * by contrast, is pulled fresh from `context.getCurrentTexture()` every frame,
 * and the swap chain resizes with the canvas element automatically. So after a
 * resize the two disagree and every pass fails validation:
 *
 *   The depth stencil attachment ... size (width: 380, height: 149) does not
 *   match the size of the other attachments' base plane (... height: 148).
 *
 * Normally `Renderer._onCanvasTargetResize` clears that cache, but the listener
 * is attached to one canvas target at a time and `setCanvasTarget` moves it on
 * every swap. With several canvases sharing a renderer, only whichever one is
 * active can hear its own resize — every other one resizes silently and then
 * renders against a stale depth view forever. The primary is no safer than the
 * secondaries here; it loses the listener as soon as a section canvas draws.
 *
 * `backend.updateSize()` drops the cached descriptor for whatever canvas target
 * is currently active. R3F sets ours at the `start` phase of our own scheduler
 * slot, so inside our `useFrame` the active target is this canvas — which makes
 * this the one place we can invalidate our own entry without disturbing anyone
 * else's.
 *
 * Remove once three rebuilds the depth view per frame, or scopes the resize
 * listener per canvas target.
