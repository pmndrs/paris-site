 * chain, not a GPU context — which is why the old shared-canvas-plus-`View`
 * design is gone.
 *
 * Two gates before anything mounts:
 *  - WebGPU is available at all (else the caller shows a poster);
 *  - the primary has registered, since a secondary with no renderer to borrow
 *    is an error rather than a fallback.
